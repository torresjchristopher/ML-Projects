## Pythagorean Theorem
For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$, and hypotenuse $c$, the relationship is:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### Proof using the area of squares

1. Consider a right triangle with legs $a$, $b$, and hypotenuse $c$.

2. Create a square with side length $a + b$ that contains four copies of the triangle, arranged so that the hypotenuse forms a square in the middle.

3. The area of the large square is:

$$
\text{Area of large square} = (a + b)^2
$$

4. Expanding this:

$$
(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
$$

5. The large square also contains four triangles, each with area:

$$
\text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2}ab
$$

Thus, the area of the four triangles is:

$$
4 \times \frac{1}{2}ab = 2ab
$$

6. The remaining area in the large square (after removing the triangles) is the area of the smaller square formed by the hypotenuse:

$$
\text{Area of small square} = c^2
$$

7. Therefore, the area of the large square can also be written as:

$$
\text{Area of large square} = c^2 + 2ab
$$

8. Setting the two expressions for the area of the large square equal:

$$
a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = c^2 + 2ab
$$

9. Subtract $2ab$ from both sides:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

This proves the Pythagorean theorem!
