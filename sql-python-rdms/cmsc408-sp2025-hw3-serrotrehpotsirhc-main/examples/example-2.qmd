## Dijkstra's Algorithm

1. Initialization:

$$
d(v) = 
\begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } v = s \\
\infty & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

2. Greedy Selection:

$$
u = \arg \min_{v \in Q} d(v)
$$

3. Relaxation:

$$
\text{if } d(u) + w(u, v) < d(v) \text{ then } d(v) = d(u) + w(u, v)
$$

4. Termination:

Repeat until$( Q )$is empty.

## Relational Algebra Division

A more complicated example of a relational algebra operation involves implementing **Division**—a challenging and somewhat abstract operator. Division is used when you need to find tuples in one relation that are related to **all** tuples in another relation.

### Problem:
Suppose we have the following relations:

- $A(X, Y)$: a relation containing pairs of values.
- $B(Y)$: a relation with a single attribute$Y$.

The goal of the division operation $A \div B$is to find all $X$ in $A$ such that for every $Y$ in $B$, there is a corresponding $(X, Y)$ pair in $A$.

### Relational Algebra Solution:
The division operation can be expressed using a combination of relational algebra operations. Here's how we can break it down:

1. **Find the Cartesian product of $X$ and $B$**:
$$
C = \Pi_X(A) \times B
$$
This is the set of all possible combinations of $X$ from $A$ with every $Y$ from $B$.

2. **Subtract pairs in$A$from the Cartesian product**:
$$
D = C - A
$$
   This step gives us the set of $(X, Y)$ -pairs that are **not** in $A$. These represent the pairs where $X$ does not match with all $Y$-values.

3. **Project the result onto $X$**:
$$
E = \Pi_X(D)
$$
This projects $D$ onto the $X$-attribute, resulting in the $X$-values that do not have corresponding pairs for all $Y$-values in $B$.

4. **Subtract from all $X$**:
$$
F = \Pi_X(A) - E
$$
This final step gives us the $X$-values that are paired with **every** $Y$-value in $B$, which is the result of $A \div B$.


### Explanation in the Context of a Database:
Imagine you have a table$A$of students and the courses they've passed, and a table$B$with a list of all required courses. The goal is to find the students (values of $X$) who have passed **all** the required courses (values of $Y$ in $B$).

This is useful in many real-world scenarios, such as checking which students are eligible to graduate or determining which products meet all necessary certifications.
