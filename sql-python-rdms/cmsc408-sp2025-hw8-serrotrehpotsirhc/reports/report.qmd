title: Homework 8 - World Bank Analysis
---

We are back again! This time we are working through Hw8, the SQL Funhouse! We are going to work through 21 queries involving our remote country database, and manipulating a local copy of the database, which we will create in Task # 4. I am extremely excited to share the results with you! Here are each of the queries, their code, and the results!

For this assignment we’ll be using data pulled containing WDI data. The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries around the world.

Its primary goal is to reduce poverty and promote economic development by offering loans, grants, and expertise for various projects, such as infrastructure development, education, and healthcare.

The World Development Indicators (WDI) is a comprehensive and extensive database maintained by the World Bank, offering a wealth of statistical information on various facets of global development.

It includes data on economic indicators like GDP, inflation rates, and trade, as well as social indicators such as education, health, and poverty.

Researchers, policymakers, analysts and students in CMSC 408 use the WDI to track development progress, conduct comparative analyses, and make informed decisions to improve the well-being of people around the world.

# Exercises

In the following exercises, we are going to write the SQL as requested to discover the answers!

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns
## Do you see any blanks or missing data?
## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT `Short Name`
FROM world_bank_data.wdi_country
WHERE `Region` IS NULL
ORDER BY `Short Name`;
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.

## Task 13

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

I feel most confident in Select statements, with the WHERE filtering. I liked building these SQL queries. I felt confide

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

Whenever I ran into trouble, the most helpful debugging tool for me was using SQLTools and connecting to the remote DM to be able to manually run SQL commands to quickly understand what each command or query would do before plugging it back in. When worse came to worse, and breaking things down using the SQLTools platform wasn't helping me progress, I asked my groupmates to help debug the more complex problems.


3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

The biggest takeaways for me was finally gettting a lot of practice using SQL! This was my first time getting a ton of practice using SQL commands, and I liked how this HW was more like a SQL problem set more than anything else. That helped me focus on my work more than worrying about troubleshooting environmental issues! These skills will propel me to be able to work with Databases in real life scenarios! This course was a great crash course into SQL, and now I will know how to actually alter Databases for real life application! I have SQL added to my toolset as a developer! It's actually rather fun working with Databses and SQL queries! But maybe that is my naivety!
